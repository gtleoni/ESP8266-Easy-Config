# ESP-Flexi-Config
Configure your ESP module from the browser

After uploading all the files to ESP module connect to ESPSensor network with the password opendoor and then visit 192.168.4.1 to enter SSID and Password of your WiFi network. 

Once configured reboot the module to boot into your network. 

Look at httpfunctions.lua file to decide what your module should do. I am posting it to dweet.io. Feel free to modify the code that suit your needs.

Note: You need latest lua firmware. The memory after installing all these files into your module will be too little so have that in mind while editing the code. The code may not be very perfect as this is my firs attempt use at your own risk ;)
